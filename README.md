This project focuses on modeling a network of towns connected by roads, managing these connections, and finding shortest paths between towns. It uses a graph data structure where nodes represent towns and edges represent roads. The main classes (Graph, Town, Road, and a FXMainPane for GUI) enable adding/removing towns and roads, retrieving information about the graph, and running shortest path algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s.
